This project revolves around a website focused on rating different cafes. All cafes that have been inputted are stored in a CSV file and can be accessed in tabular form on the website at /cafes. To add a new cafe, the user needs to input /add via the keyboard to reach the corresponding page where they can input the cafe's details. The website is fairly straightforward and serves as a means for me to learn Flask and Bootstrap, along with some Jinja and HTML modifications.
